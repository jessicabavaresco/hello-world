### Jessica Bavaresco, Marco Túlio Quintino, Leonardo Guerini, Thiago O. Maciel, Daniel Cavalcanti, and Marcelo Terra Cunha

This is a repository for all code which was used and described in the article "*[Most incompatible measurements for robust steering tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02994)*".

All code is written in MATLAB and requires:
- [Yalmip](https://yalmip.github.io) - a MATLAB-based convex modeling framework
- [QETLAB](http://www.qetlab.com/) - A MATLAB Toolbox for Quantum Entanglement

As dicussed in the article, the code is separeted in three main methods that performe different tasks: the search algorithm, the see-saw algorithm, and the outer polytope approximation.

- Search algorithm:
 
- See-saw algorithm:
 
- Outer polytope approximation<sup>§</sup>:
 
<sup>§</sup>: The outer polytope approximation code also requires:
- [CDDMEX](http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~cohysys/cdd.php) - A MATLAB interface for the CDD solver.
